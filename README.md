An enterprise-grade, private winget repository server written in Python. For an
overview of the project and its features, please see
[our homepage](https://winget.pro).

## Getting started

If you are here, then you probably want to run winget.pro yourself. Follow the
instructions in the [`run/`](run) directory to get started. There should be
something for every environment.

## Comparison to the hosted and enterprise versions

The code in this repository gives you a functional private repository. However,
it lacks certain benefits that are part of winget.pro's paid editions:

 * This repository receives security fixes with a delay of 6 months.
 * [Entra ID authentication](https://winget.pro/winget-entra-id-authentication/)
 * Automatic backups

If you would like any of these benefits, either in an on-premise deployment or
hosted by us, please sign up or enquire about a paid plan at
https://winget.pro/start/. We would love to have you as a customer.

## Getting help

If you need help or find a bug, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/omaha-consulting/winget.pro/issues). We will
do our best to help. Feature and pull requests are also welcome!

Finally, if you like this repository, then please star it. Seeing the star count
grow is a great reward for our open source efforts :-)
