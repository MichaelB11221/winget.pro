An enterprise-grade, private winget repository server written in Python. For an
overview of the project and its features, please see
[our homepage](https://winget.pro).

If you are here, then you probably want to run winget.pro yourself. Follow the
instructions in the [`run/`](run) directory to get started. There should be
something for every environment.

A caveat of this repository is that it receives security fixes with a delay of
3 months. This gives our enterprise customers time to patch vulnerabilities
before they become public. You can request immediate access to security fixes by
getting in touch with us [here](https://winget.pro/start/).

If you need help or find a bug, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/omaha-consulting/winget.pro/issues). We will
do our best to help. Feature and pull requests are also welcome!

Finally, if you like this repository, then please star it. Seeing the star count
grow is a great reward for our open source efforts :-)
